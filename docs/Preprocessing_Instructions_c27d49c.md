## Preprocessing Instructions

Preprocessing intructions are processed by the XML preprocessor when it traverses the view's `XML DOM`.

> Note:
> A model name can be seen as a variable with a value that consists of two parts: a model instance and a binding context path.
> 
> 

You can base conditions on the available variables. XML attributes that represent an available binding are replaced automatically.
