## Upgrading from a Version Below 1.40

***

### Older jQuery Versions Removed

As of this version, OpenUI5 only contains one version of jQuery \(the current version is 2.2.3\). This standard version is always used when no other jQuery version is included in the bootstrap of an app. If you need a specific jQuery version for your app, add and load it explicitly as described in [noJQuery Variant for Bootstrapping](noJQuery_Variant_for_Bootstrapping_91f1dd0.md). Check the console for the related warning message if you are unsure which version you are using.
