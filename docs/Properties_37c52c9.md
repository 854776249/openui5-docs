## Properties

The `swipeDirection` property for lists and tables is used to configure the direction of the swipe event. This property accepts an enumeration from `sap.m.SwipeDirection?` with the following values:

-   `LeftToRight?`: Swipe from left to right
-   `RightToLeft?`: Swipe from right to left
-   `Both`: Both directions \(left to right, or right to left\)

The default value is `Both`, but in some use cases we recommend that you change this property, for example to prevent swipe conflicts.
