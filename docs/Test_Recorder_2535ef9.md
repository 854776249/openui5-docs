## Test Recorder

The Test Recorder tool supports app developers to write integration and system tests.

Test Recorder is part of the OpenUI5 framework and is available in all browsers. You can use the tool in any existing OpenUI5 app to inspect the rendered user interface \(UI\), view the control properties, and gain hints on writing tests. Test Recorder is aligned with the two official OpenUI5 testing tools - OPA5 and UIVeri5.

### Getting Started

There are two ways to open the Test Recorder:

-   In a separate window - press * CTRL SHIFT ALT T *.

-   In an IFrame - press * CTRL SHIFT ALT P * \(to display the *Technical Information Dialog*\) and then choose *Activate Test Recorder*.

     ![](loio1e0b9fe13e6d44589301c80d5e5b07bb_HiRes.png) 


From the navigation actions at the top bar of the Test Recorder, you can minimize, resize, switch between IFrame and window modes, and close the Test Recorder.

### Structure and Usage

The main sections of the tool are *Control Tree*, *Snippet*, and *Common Information*.

***

#### *Control Tree* and *Common Information* Sections

In the *Control Tree* section, you can see the DOM structure of the current app page. When navigating to another page or view, the tree is automatically updated.

You can display more information in the *Control Tree* by selecting the *Namespaces* and *Attributes* checkboxes. Entering text in the *Search* field, highlights all elements that \(partially\) match by namespace, control name, or attribute values.

> Note:
> Elements in the *Control Tree* get highlighted if there's a match by namespace or attribute value even when the *Namespaces* and *Attributes* checkboxes are not selected and the information isn't displayed.
> 
> 

There are three general types of information, relevant to testing, that you can gather for any control:

-   Order in the rendered control tree, type and ID – displayed in the *Control Tree* section.

    To see the control type, select the *Namespace* checkbox. To see the ID, select the *Attributes* checkbox.

-   Properties \(either own or inherited\) – displayed in the *Common Information* section under the *Properties* tab.

-   Bindings \(binding context, properties, and aggregations\) – displayed in the *Common Information* section under the *Bindings* tab.


> Note:
> -   The IDs can be generated \(not stable\) and therefore not suitable for tests.
> 
> -   Many controls can have the same property or binding values and therefore, when you use them in a control locator, the test finds multiple controls. This is a valid scenario but it’s always more reliable to locate only one control with a highly specific locator.

#### Actions

You can perform the following actions on controls, either from the *Control Tree* or from the rendered UI of the app:

-   **Highlight:** Generates a code snippet for finding the control which can be used to assert the control state.

-   **Press:** Generates a code snippet for pressing on the control.

-   **Enter Text:** Generates a code snippet for entering text into the control.


To perform an action from the *Control Tree*, right click and use the context menu for *Press* and *Enter Text*, or simply select the desired element for *Highlight* \(the respective control in the rendered UI gets highlighted\).

To perform an action from the app page, right click on any control and select the desired action from the context menu \(the respective control in the *Control Tree* gets highlighted\).

***

#### *Snippets* Section

The code snippets generated by the Test Recorder usually contain a function invocation that locates one control on the app page. The function receives one argument – a control locator. The control location is a JSON object containing a specific combination of conditions and matchers.

The code snippet is intended to be directly copied and pasted into your test code and is aligned with the supported tools for testing - OPA5 and UIVeri5.

To choose the tool for which to generate a code snippet, select an option from the *Dialect* dropdown menu.

 ![]() 

The raw dialect gives you just the control locator with no function invocations.
